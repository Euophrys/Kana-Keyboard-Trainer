If you just want to download the built files, see the Releases page: https://github.com/Euophrys/Kana-Keyboard-Trainer/releases

If you're paranoid, you can download Godot at https://godotengine.org/ and run it in the engine or build it yourself.

I'd never used Godot before this so it might not fit with normal Godot conventions.
